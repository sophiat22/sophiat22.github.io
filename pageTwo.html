		<h2>The 1st Law: Make it Obvious</h2>
		<h3>Implementation Intention</h3>
		<p>Implementaiotn intention is a plan you make beforehand baout what and wehre to act -- how you intend to implement a particular habt. The broad format is: "When situation X arises, I will perform response Y." A simple way to plan your implementaion intentions is to write the out using the template of this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION</p>
		<h3>Habit Stacking</h3>
		<p>The goal of habit staking is to tie you desired behavior into something you alread do each day. You can then create larger stacks of habits by chaining small habits together.</p>

		<p> Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you'll stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can be repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the cue for the next.</p>
		<h3>Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment</h3>
		<p>B = f(P,E) - People often choose products not because of what they are but because of where they are. Hawkins Stern described this as Suggestion Impulse Buying, which "is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it." In order to design one's environment for success, context is the cue. A single trigger for a habit is the entire context surrounding the behavior. Making habits obvious is key.</p>
		<h3>The 1st Law: Make it Obvious</h3>

		<h4>1.2 Use implementation intentions: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."</h4>
		<h4>1.3 Uhse habit stacking: "After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."</h4>
		<h4>1.4 Design your environment. Make the cues fo good habits obvious and visible.</h4>
		<h4>Inversion of the 1st Law: Make it invisible - 1.5 Reduce Exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment</h4>
