		<h2>The 4th Law: Make it Satisfying</h2>
		<h3>How to Keep Your Habits on Track</h3>
		<h4>Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.</h4>
		<p>Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X's on your calendar. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.</p>
		<h4>Benefit #2: Habit Tracking is attractive.</h4>
		<p> The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire. When you're feeling down, it's easy to forget about all of the progress you have already made. Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work--a subtle reminder of how far you've come.</p>
		<h4>Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.</h4>
		<p>Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-dolist, to complete an entry in your log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow--the size of your investment portfolio, the lenght of your book manuscript--and if it feels good, then you're more likely to endure.</p>
		<h3>What can we do to make habit tracking easier?</h3>
		<p>Whenever possible, measurement should be automated. You'll be surprsied by how much you're already tracking without knowing it. Additionally, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is better to consistently trakc one habit than to sporadically track ten. Record each measurment immediately after the habit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This approach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method with habit tracking.

		The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:
		After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].
		</p>
		<h3>The Habit Contract</h3>
		<p>Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to low through. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off the contract for you.</p>
		<h3>The 4th Law: Make it Satisfying</h3>
		<h4>4.1 Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.</h4>
		<h4>4.2 Make "doing nothing" enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.</h4>
		<h4>4.3 Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and don't "break the chain."</h4>
		<h4>4.4 Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.</h4>
		<h4>Inversion of the 4th Law - 4.5 Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behavior.</h4>
		<h4>Inversion of teh 4th Law - 4.6 Create a habit contract. Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful.</h4>
