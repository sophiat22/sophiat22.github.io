		<h2>The 3rd Law: Make it Easy</h2>
		<h3>The Habit Line</h3>

		<p>In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effort and concentration to perform. After a few repetitions, (point B), it gets easier, but still requires some conscious attention. With enough practice (point C), the habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold--the habit line--the behavior can be done more or less without thinking. A new habit has been formed.</p>
		<h3>Decisive Moments</h3>
		<img src = decisiveMoments.jpg alt="Decisive Moments" class = "center" width="300" height="335" title = "Decisive Moments">
		<p>The difference between a good day and a bad day is osten a few productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is like a fork in the orad, and these choices stack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.</p>
		<h3>The Two-Minute Rule</h3>
		<p>The Two-Minute Rule states, "When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do." As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a ritual at the beginng of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.</p>
		<h3>Habit Shaping</h3>
		<p>At some point, once you've established the habit and you're showing up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Then, advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process--focusing on just the first two minutes and mastering the stage before moving on to the next level. Eventually, you'll end up with the habit you had originally hoped to build while still keeping your focus on where it should be: on the first two minutes of the behavior.</p> 
		<h3>The 3rd Law: Make it Easy</h3>
		<h4>3.1 Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.</h4>
		<h4>3.2 Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.</h4>
		<h4>3.3 Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.</h4>
		<h4>3.4 Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.</h4>
		<h4>3.5 Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchase that lock in future behavior.</h4>
		<h4>Inversion of the 3rd Law - 3.6 Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.</h4>
		<h4> Inversion of the 3rd Law - 3.7 Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you.</h4>
