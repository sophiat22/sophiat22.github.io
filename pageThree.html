		<h2>The 2nd Law: Make it Attractive</h2>
		<h3>The Dopamine Spike</h3>

		<p>Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released when the reward is experienced for the first time. The next time around (B), dopamine rises before taking action, immediately after a cue is recognized. This spike leads to a feeling of desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue is spotted. Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is expereinced because you already expect the reward. However, if you see a cue and expect a reward, but do not get one, then dopamine will drop in disappointment (C). The sensitivity of the dopamine response can clearly be seen when a reward is provided late (D). First, the cue is identified and dopamine rises as craving builds. Next, a response is taken but the reward does not come as quickly as expected and dopamine begins to drop. Finally, the reward comes a little later than you had oped, dopamine spikes again. It is as if the brain is saying, "See! I knew I was right. Don't forget to repeat this action next time."</p>
		<h3>Temptation Bundiling</h3>
		<p>Temptation bundling works by linking an action you wnat to do with an action you need to do. You can even combine temptation bundling with habit stacking to create a set of rules to guide your behavior. The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:
		1. After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
		2. After [HABIT I NEEDED], I will [HABIT I WANT].</p> 
		<h3>The 2nd Law: Make it Attractive</h3>
		<h4>2.1 Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</h4>
		<h4>2.2 Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.</h4>
		<h4>2.3 Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.</h4>
		<h4>Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make it Unattractive - 2.4 Reframe your mind-set. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits.</h4>
